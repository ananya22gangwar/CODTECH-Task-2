Overview of the Project:

Project: Fraud detction in transcation

Objective:
Develop an ML model to detect credit card fraud in transactions by analyzing patterns and identifying suspicious activities in real-time.

Key Activities:
Data Collection: Gather transaction data, including features like transaction amount, location, time, and user behavior.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, normalizing, and encoding categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data patterns, distributions, and correlations to identify key indicators of fraudulent behavior.


Technologies Used:
Python: Primary programming language for developing ML models
TensorFlow: Framework for building and training deep learning models.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Library for numerical computations, essential for data processing.
Jupyter Notebooks: Environment for writing and testing code interactively.

Key Insights:
Anomalous Behavior Signals Fraud: Machine learning models excel at identifying unusual transaction patterns that deviate from a user's typical behavior, which often indicates fraud.
Real-Time Detection is Critical: Effective fraud detection systems must operate in real-time, enabling immediate action to prevent financial losses.
Imbalanced Data Challenges: Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, requiring techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or anomaly detection algorithms to handle data imbalance.
Feature Engineering is Key: Crafting features such as transaction frequency, time intervals, and geographic location improves the model's ability to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities.
